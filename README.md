# Makefile Plus
A simple yet effective Makefile syntax for Sublime Text

### Installation via Package Control
If you have Package Control, you can just install it by searching for "Makefile Plus"

### Manual Installation
In order to install this syntax, copy the `makefile-plus.tmLanguage` file into your `Packages/User` directory.
You can find it by going into `Preferences -> Browse Packages` in Sublime Text.

### Details
Currently, the syntax file is generated with the help of [PackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/PackageDev).
The syntax is written in .YAML-tmLanguage, then is transformed into a .tmLanguage file (TextMate format).

A full transition into .sublime-syntax format is not considered at this time, since this format is specific to Sublime Text 3 (build >= 3084).
